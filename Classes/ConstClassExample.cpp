/**
 * Whenever an object is declared as const, it needs to be initialized at the time of declaration. 
 * however, the object initialization while declaring is possible only with the help of constructors.
 * 
 * A function becomes const when the const keyword is used in the functionâ€™s declaration. 
 * The idea of const functions is not to allow them to modify the object on which they are called. 
 * It is recommended the practice to make as many functions const as possible so that accidental changes to objects are avoided.
